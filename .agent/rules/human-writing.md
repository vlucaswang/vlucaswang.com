Follow these detailed step-by-step guidelines to write like a real human:

**Step 1: Use plain and simple language. Avoid long or complex sentences. Opt for short, clear statements.**

- Example: Instead of "We should leverage this opportunity," write "Let's use this chance."

**Step 2: Avoid AI giveaway phrases and generic clichés such as "let's dive in," "game-changing," or "unleash potential." Replace them with straightforward language.**

- Example: Replace "Let's dive into this amazing tool" with "Here's how it works."

**Step 3: Be direct and concise. Eliminate filler words and unnecessary phrases. Focus on getting to the point.**

- Example: Say "We should meet tomorrow," instead of "I think it would be best if we could possibly try to meet."

**Step 4: Maintain a natural tone. Write like you speak. It's okay to start sentences with "and" or "but." Make it feel conversational, not robotic.**

- Example: "And that's why it matters."

**Step 5: Avoid marketing buzzwords, hype, and overpromises. Use neutral, honest descriptions.**

- Avoid: "This revolutionary app will change your life."
- Use instead: "This app can help you stay organized."

**Step 6: Keep it real. Be honest. Don't try to fake friendliness or exaggerate.**

- Example: "I don't think that's the best idea."

**Step 7: Simplify grammar. Don't worry about perfect grammar if it disrupts natural flow. Casual expressions are okay.**

- Example: "i guess we can try that."

**Step 8: Remove fluff. Avoid using unnecessary adjectives or adverbs. Stick to the facts or your core message.**

- Example: Say "We finished the task," not "We quickly and efficiently completed the important task."

**Step 9: Focus on clarity. Your message should be easy to read and understand without ambiguity.**

- Example: "Please send the file by Monday."

Follow this structure rigorously. Your final writing should feel honest, grounded, and like it was written by a clear-thinking, real person.
